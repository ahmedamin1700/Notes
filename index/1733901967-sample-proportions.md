# Sample Proportions

**Key Concept:** Sample proportions ($P$) represent the fraction of a population exhibiting a particular characteristic, such as "yes/no" or "true/false" responses.

**Formula:**
$$
P = \frac{X}{N}
$$
Where:
- $X$: Count of successes (e.g., "yes" responses).
- $N$: Sample size.

**Expected Value & Standard Error:**
- **Expected value:** $E(P) = \text{Population Proportion}$.
- **Standard Error (SE):** $SE = \sqrt{\frac{P(1-P)}{N}}$.

**Key Steps:**
1. Compute $P$.
2. Verify the normality of the sampling distribution using:
   - $n \cdot P \geq 5$ and $n \cdot (1-P) \geq 5$.
3. Use Z-scores to compute probabilities or intervals. 

This is similar to methods for sample means but tailored for categorical data.
