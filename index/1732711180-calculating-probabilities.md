# Calculating probabilities

To be able to find the probabilities of an event will be calculated
as number of all sucess divided on all possible outcomes.

$$
P(A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(s)}
$$

## Complementary events

Thereâ€™s a shorthand way of indicating the event
that A does not occur A'.

$$
P(A') = 1 - P(A)
$$

## Exclusive events and intersecting events

### Matually Exclusive

Events Events like the ball landing in a black or red pocket can't happen at
the same time.

$$
P(\text{Black} or \text{Red}) = P(\text{Black}) + P(\text{Red})
$$

### Intersecting Events

Events such as the ball landing in a black and even pocket can occur
simultaneously.

$$
P(\text{Black} or \text{Red}) = P(\text{Black}) + P(\text{Red})
$$
