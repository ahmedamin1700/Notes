# Measures of spread and variability

## Range

The difference between the smallest variable and the largest.

## IQR = Interquartile

IQR = 3rd quartile - 1st quartile.

## Variance

The average of the distances from the mean squared.

$$
variance = \frac{ \Sigma (x - \mu)^2}{n}
$$
## Standard deviation

The standard deviation is a way of saying how far
typical values are from the mean. The smaller the standard deviation,
the closer values are to the mean. The smallest value the standard
deviation can take is 0.

$$
σ = √variance
$$

## Z-score

Standard scores, or z-scores, allow for the comparison of values
across different data sets with varying means and standard deviations
by standardizing the data.

$$
z = \frac{x - μ}{σ}
$$
