# Uniform Distributions

1. **Key Concepts**:
  - Uniform distributions have equal probabilities for all outcomes.
  - **Discrete**: Finite, equally likely outcomes (e.g., coin flips, die rolls).
  - **Continuous**: Infinite outcomes (e.g., time, mass) with probability for intervals, not specific values.

2. **Formulas**:
  - Probability density: $f(x) = \frac{1}{b - a}$ (height of the rectangle).
  - Expected value: $E(X) = \frac{a + b}{2}$.
  - Variance: $\text{Var}(X) = \frac{(b - a)^2}{12}$.
  - Standard deviation: $\sigma = \sqrt{\text{Var}(X)}$.

3. **Key Insight**:
   Continuous outcomes approach infinity; probabilities for specific outcomes are essentially zero. Probabilities are computed for intervals.
