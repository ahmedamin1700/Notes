# Sampling Distributions

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Point Estimation**: Use sample data to infer population characteristics.
2. **Sampling Distributions**: Derived from the means of multiple samples from the population.
3. **Population vs. Sample**:
   - Population characteristics (parameters) include the true mean (\( \mu \)).
   - Sample statistics include sample means (\( \bar{x} \)).
4. **Expected Value**: The mean of the sampling distribution equals the population mean.
5. **Importance of Sample Size**: Larger samples provide more accurate population estimates.
6. **Application**: Helps estimate population characteristics and analyze confidence intervals.
