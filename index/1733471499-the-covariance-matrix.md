# The Covariance Matrix

A structured representation of variances (on the diagonal) and covariances (off-diagonal) for multiple variables.
  - Variance = diagonal entries (e.g., variance of $X_1$ with itself).
  - [[1733470287-understanding-covariance|covariance]] = off-diagonal entries (e.g., covariance between $X_1$ and $X_2$).
  - Widely used in finance and statistical analysis to study relationships among variables.
