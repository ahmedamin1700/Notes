# Discrete probability distributions

To calculate the expectation (or expected value) of a variable $(X)$, which represents the amount you could gain or lose on slot machines, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Formula**: The expectation $E(X)$ is calculated by multiplying each value $x$ by the probability $P(X = x)$ of getting that value, and then summing all the results. The formula is:

$$
E(X) = \sum_{i} x_i \cdot P(X = x_i)
$$

2. **Apply the Values**: Given the values and their probabilities:
   - x = -1, 4, 9, 14, 19
   - $( P(X = x)$ = 0.977, 0.008, 0.008, 0.006, 0.001

3. **Calculate Each Term**: Multiply each value by its corresponding probability:
   - $-1 \cdot 0.977 = -0.977$
   - $4 \cdot 0.008 = 0.032$
   - $9 \cdot 0.008 = 0.072$
   - $14 \cdot 0.006 = 0.084$
   - $19 \cdot 0.001 = 0.019$

4. **Sum the Results**: Add all the products to get the expectation:
   $$
   E(X) = -0.977 + 0.032 + 0.072 + 0.084 + 0.019 = -0.77
   $$

Therefore, the expectation \( E(X) \) tells you that, on average, you can expect to lose 0.77 units per game. This helps you understand your long-term expected gain or loss on the slot machines.
