# Understanding Correlation

## correlation vs. covariance
  - covariance shows **direction** (positive, negative, zero).
  - correlation shows **direction and strength** (ranges from $-1$ to $+1$).
  - correlation is **standardized** and independent of units, unlike covariance.

## pearson correlation coefficient 
$$
r = \frac{\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sigma_X \cdot \sigma_Y}
$$
- uses covariance and standard deviations to compute.

## key insights
  - always analyze scatterplots before calculating correlation.
  - correlation applies only to **linear relationships**.
  - **Correlation â‰  Causation**.
