# Standard Error Of The Mean

The **standard error of the mean (SEM)** is the standard deviation of a sampling distribution, reflecting how sample means vary. It is calculated as:
$$
\text{SEM} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

Where:
- $\sigma$: population standard deviation
- $n$: sample size

Key Points:
1. Larger sample sizes reduce SEM, narrowing the sampling distribution and improving approximation to the population mean.
2. SEM differs from population standard deviation ($\sigma$), as it measures sample mean variability.
3. Same-sized samples have identical SEM regardless of their means.

SEM is crucial in inferential statistics, estimating population parameters with error margins and confidence intervals.
