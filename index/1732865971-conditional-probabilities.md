# Conditional probabilities

To generalize the calculation of conditional probabilities, we use the notation \( P(A | B) \), which represents the probability of event \( A \) occurring given that event \( B \) has already occurred. This can be calculated using the formula:

$$
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
$$

Where:
- \( P(A \cap B) \) is the probability of both events \( A \) and \( B \) occurring.
- \( P(B) \) is the probability of event \( B \) occurring.

While Venn diagrams can sometimes be challenging for visualizing conditional probabilities, probability trees offer a clear alternative. Probability trees help visualize and calculate the probabilities of different outcomes step by step, making it easier to understand the relationships between events.

Here’s a brief summary of the concepts:
1. **Notation**: Conditional probability \( P(A | B) \) uses the “|” symbol to mean “given.”
2. **Formula**: Calculate \( P(A | B) \) using \( P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \).
3. **Visualization**: Probability trees can be more effective than Venn diagrams for visualizing conditional probabilities.

By using these methods, you can effectively calculate and understand conditional probabilities in various scenarios.
