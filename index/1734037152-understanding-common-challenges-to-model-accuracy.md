# Understanding Common Challenges to Model Accuracy

**Key Notes on Accuracy**:
- Accurate models improve predictions, optimize resource allocation, manage risks, and enhance decision-making and competitiveness.
- Challenges in accuracy stem from **bias** (oversimplification of patterns, leading to poor performance) and **variance** (overfitting and sensitivity to noise in data).

**Causes of Bias**:
- Model simplicity, under-representative features, incorrect assumptions.

**Causes of Variance**:
- Over-complexity, insufficient data, over-reliance on noise.

**Reducing Bias and Variance**:
- Adjust complexity, add relevant features, apply dimensionality reduction, or increase training data.

**Common Challenges**:
- **Heteroskedasticity**: Addressed via transformations, weighted regression, or robust errors.
- **Endogeneity**: Managed using instrumental variables, control variables, or difference-in-differences analysis.
