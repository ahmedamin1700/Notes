# Understanding covariance

covariance measures how two variables move together:
  - **Positive covariance**: both increase or decrease together.
  - **Negative covariance**: one increases while the other decreases.
  - **Zero covariance**: no clear linear relationship.

## Mathematical formula

$$
S_{XY} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{n - 1}
$$  
where $\bar{X}$ and $\bar{Y}$ are means of $X$ and $Y$.
