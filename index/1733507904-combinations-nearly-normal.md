# Combinations Nearly Normal

## combinations overview
   - formula: $C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$
   - counts groups of size $r$ from $n$ elements.

## finite math and statistics link
   - combination frequencies plotted as histograms approximate the **normal curve** as $n \to \infty$.
   - demonstrates how discrete (histograms) transitions to continuous (normal distribution).

## importance
   - Shows theoretical foundation of the normal curve from finite counting principles.
   - Helps understand probabilities in statistics through combinations.
