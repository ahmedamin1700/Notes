# Combinations Nearly Normal

### Summary: **Combinations and the Normal Curve**

1. **Combinations Overview**:
   - Formula: \( C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \)
   - Counts groups of size \( r \) from \( n \) elements.

2. **Finite Math and Statistics Link**:
   - Combination frequencies plotted as histograms approximate the **normal curve** as \( n \to \infty \).
   - Demonstrates how discrete (histograms) transitions to continuous (normal distribution).

3. **Importance**:
   - Shows theoretical foundation of the normal curve from finite counting principles.
   - Helps understand probabilities in statistics through combinations.
